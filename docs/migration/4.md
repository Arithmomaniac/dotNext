Migration from 4.x
====
Some features from 4.x are replaced by native language constructs from C# 12 or by API from .NET 8. For instance, `OneDimensionalArray` is completely removed in favor of collection literals. `FirstOrNone` or `FirstOrNull` extension methods are removed in favor of [list patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/functional/pattern-matching#list-patterns).

# Core library
`BufferHelpers` divided into the following classes: `CharBuffer`, `ByteBuffer`, and `Memory` static classes. `MemoryAllocator` static class merged with `Memory` static class. `AllocateAtLeast` and `AllocateExactly` static methods are introduced in favor of `bool exactSize` parameter.

Removed `AsyncDelegate`` in favor of [TaskToAsyncResult](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.threading.tasks.tasktoasyncresult).

Some methods in `BinaryTransformations` are removed in favor of [BinaryPrimitives.ReverseEndianness](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.buffers.binary.binaryprimitives.reverseendianness) methods.

`Reference<T>` is removed without alternative API as too specific type.

`Sequence` static class merged with `List`, `Collection`, `AsyncEnumerable`, and `Enumerator` static classes.

`DotNext.Generic` namespace is completely removed in favor of static abstract interface members. Now generic constant can be emulated as follows:
```csharp
public interface IConstant<T>
{
    static abstract T Value { get; }
}
```

# IO
`IAsyncBinaryReader` and `IAsyncBinaryWriter` interfaces are redesigned to utilize [Generic Math](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/generics/math) features.

# Interop Services
`AtomicPointer` is completely removed. Use `Pointer<T>.Value` instead.

# Raft
UDP transport support is completely removed. Use TCP instead.

# Reflection
`DotNext.Reflection` library is no longer supported and removed. See [this](https://github.com/dotnet/dotNext/discussions/142) announcement.
